1. Briefly describe your method for preventing the adversary from learning information about
the lengths of the passwords stored in your password manager.
To prevent the adversary from learning information regarding the length of our passwords,
 we added additional padding so all passwords would be the same size. We would pad these 
 passwords up to the maximum size given by the specs sheet.


2. Briefly describe your method for preventing swap attacks (Section 2.2). Provide an argument
for why the attack is prevented in your scheme.
In our implementation of the password manager, we go ahead and bind every cipher text to the domain
of the domain in question. So for example, if we are looking for the cipher text around evil.com, 
then we will bind the encryption of evil.com to its own domain.
When we decrypt, we will also use that same domain to decrypt it, but if it fails the decryption
then we will go ahead and realize it is a swap attack. This prevents a swap attack because an attacker
can go ahead and swap any two entries, but since we've encrypted every ciphertext with the domain provided,
decryption will fail if the wrong domain is provided.


3. In our proposed defense against the rollback attack (Section 2.2), we assume that we can store
the SHA-256 hash in a trusted location beyond the reach of an adversary. Is it necessary to
assume that such a trusted location exists, in order to defend against rollback attacks? Briefly
justify your answer.


4. Because HMAC is a deterministic MAC (that is, its output is the same if it is run multiple
times with the same input), we were able to look up domain names using their HMAC values.
There are also randomized MACs, which can output different tags on multiple runs with the
same input. Explain how you would do the look up if you had to use a randomized MAC
instead of HMAC. Is there a performance penalty involved, and if so, what?

5. In our specification, we leak the number of records in the password manager. Describe an
approach to reduce the information leaked about the number of records. Specifically, if there
are k records, your scheme should only leak ⌊log2 (k)⌋ (that is, if k1 and k2 are such that 
⌊log2(k1)⌋ = ⌊log2(k2)⌋, the attacker should not be able to distinguish between a case where
the true number of records is k1 and another case where the true number of records is k2).

6. What is a way we can add multi-user support for specific sites to our password manager
system without compromising security for other sites that these users may wish to store
passwords of? That is, if Alice and Bob wish to access one stored password (say for nytimes)
that either of them can get and update, without allowing the other to access their passwords
for other websites.
